# Jamatia's Mini OS Shell

Welcome to **Jamatia's Mini OS Shell**â€”a custom, interactive shell environment designed to simulate basic command-line operations for both Windows and Mac/Linux systems. This shell offers built-in commands, environment-specific functions, and session time-tracking, making it a unique utility for practicing and experimenting with common shell commands.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a lightweight and interactive shell environment that simulates basic command-line functionality for both Windows and Mac/Linux operating systems. This shell will help users:

- Learn and practice essential shell commands used in different OS environments.
- Understand the behavior and syntax of various system-level commands.
- Experiment with file management, network utilities, and process control using a command-line interface.
- Track session time and gain insights into shell usage patterns.
- Provide an accessible platform for users to interact with and explore different operating system environments via a single shell interface.

## Technologies Used

- **C Programming Language**: The shell is implemented in C, providing low-level control over system processes.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Used as the primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and testing the Mini OS Shell.

## Key C Programming Concepts Demonstrated

This project highlights several important aspects of C programming, demonstrating both basic and advanced techniques:

### 1. **Standard Input/Output (I/O)**
   - **Usage of `printf` and `scanf`**: These functions are used to interact with the user, display information, and read user inputs. 
   - Example:
     ```c
     printf("Select environment (Windows/Mac/Linux): ");
     scanf("%s", environment);
     ```

### 2. **String Manipulation**
   - **Handling strings**: The project involves manipulating strings using C string functions like `strcpy`, `strlen`, and `strcmp`.
   - Example:
     ```c
     if (strcmp(command, "exit") == 0) {
         printf("Exiting the shell...\n");
         break;
     }
     ```

### 3. **Memory Management**
   - **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: `malloc` and `free` are used to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically for various data structures (like user inputs).
   - Example:
     ```c
     char *input = (char *)malloc(100 * sizeof(char));
     if (input == NULL) {
         printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
         exit(1);
     }
     free(input);
     ```

### 4. **Process Control**
   - **System Calls and `fork()`**: Using `fork()` to create new processes and `execvp()` to execute commands in a child process.
   - Example:
     ```c
     pid_t pid = fork();
     if (pid == 0) {
         execvp(command, args);  // Execute command in child process
     } else {
         wait(NULL);  // Parent waits for child process to finish
     }
     ```

### 5. **File I/O**
   - **File Operations**: Using `fopen()`, `fclose()`, `fread()`, and `fwrite()` to interact with files, simulating file navigation and management commands.
   - Example:
     ```c
     FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
     if (file != NULL) {
         fread(buffer, sizeof(char), 100, file);
         fclose(file);
     }
     ```

### 6. **Control Structures**
   - **Conditionals and Loops**: Mastery of `if`, `else`, `for`, and `while` loops to control program flow based on user inputs and command execution.
   - Example:
     ```c
     while (1) {
         printf("MiniShell> ");
         fgets(command, 100, stdin);
         if (strcmp(command, "exit") == 0) break;
     }
     ```

### 7. **Error Handling**
   - **Error Checking**: Proper error handling is implemented using `perror()` and checking return values of system calls and library functions.
   - Example:
     ```c
     if (system(command) == -1) {
         perror("Command execution failed");
     }
     ```

### 8. **Session Time Tracking**
   - **Time Functions**: Using the `time.h` library to track session time and display elapsed time after each command.
   - Example:
     ```c
     time_t start_time, end_time;
     time(&start_time);
     // Execute command...
     time(&end_time);
     printf("Time spent in shell: %.2f seconds\n", difftime(end_time, start_time));
     ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-os-shell.git
   cd mini-os-shell
   ```

2. Compile the shell program:
   ```bash
   gcc mini_os_shell.c -o mini_os_shell
   ```

3. Run the shell program:
   ```bash
   ./mini_os_shell
   ```

## Usage

When you run the shell, it will prompt you to select an environment:

- **Windows**: Simulates commands typically available on Windows.
- **Mac/Linux**: Simulates commands specific to Unix-like systems.

Once an environment is selected, the shell will display a welcome message, and you can start entering commands.
